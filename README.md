# Graph Plotter for Numerical Methods

In case you want to compile the code, you'll need:
- CMake 3.20 or higher
- Qt 6.2.0 or higher

To make it work, just change the address to the location of your Qt in these to strings:
```
set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "C:\\Qt\\6.2.0\\mingw81_64\\lib\\cmake")
set(QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE "C:\\Qt\\6.2.0\\mingw81_64\\bin\\qmake6.exe")

```
